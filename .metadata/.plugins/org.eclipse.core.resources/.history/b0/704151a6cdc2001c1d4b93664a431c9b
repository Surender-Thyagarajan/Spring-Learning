<!--  Autowiring removes manual dependency reference
	  Autowiring byName matches the dependency's name with the bean id if any automatically. (ie) point1 obj mathces point1 bean
	  Autowiring byType matches the dependency's type (class/datatype)) with the bean's type if any. But this method is applicable only if there is only one dependency for the specified type. If two or more is present for the same type then spring gets confused.
